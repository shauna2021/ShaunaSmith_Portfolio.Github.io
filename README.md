I am a hard-working mother of 2 and I have an innate passion for learning and discovery. I explore many methods to achieve a multitude of evolving goals and shared communication. My biggest achievements stem from my inquisitive nature and imaginative personality which I consistently envoke for new exploration and discovery. I strive for aspiring for honest perspectives that I am always ready to share. I love life, and learning how to best live it! Stay tuned, and get to know me as I share how to look at life in often unique but revealing ways.

[# Project 1 "FERB"](https://github.com/shauna2021/ShaunaSmith_Portfolio.Github.io/blob/main/Assignment4.1_P1_M3_SmithShauna.ipynb)

FERB is an acronym for (Friendly. Educational. Repository. Bank of pets) and is a service for predictive success regarding a catered commitment to the breed of dog by expectations for training repetitions for a desired behavior. The end goal is a methodology of practice to predict the best fit for families. This is achieved by setting an encouraged commitment to expectations for adoption permanence.

[# Project 2 "ARP-Scores"](https://github.com/shauna2021/ShaunaSmith_Portfolio.Github.io/blob/main/SmithS_DSC630_Milestone4.ipynb)

ARP-Scores is a project designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of implementing feature strategies to improve reading, writing, and math scores. This uses a model with decision trees to show the importance of impact on score rates. The end goal is to provide evidence in support of specific mitigation efforts that will impact improvements in the most efficient manner for ARP funds to supplement them.

[# Project 3 "Movie Recommender"](https://github.com/shauna2021/ShaunaSmith_Portfolio.Github.io/blob/main/SmithSDSC630Week10%20(1).ipynb)

The Movie Recommender explores an open-source dataset with ratings and genres. This was used to create a correlative recommender system, to suggest similarly rated and genre movies to a user's selected movie preference input.

[# Project 4 "Time Series Retail"](https://github.com/shauna2021/ShaunaSmith_Portfolio.Github.io/blob/main/SmithSDSC630Week8.ipynb)

Time Series Retail offers a viewing window for correlative retail sales partitioned across a select time series. In turn, this grants data visualization potential to demonstrate trends or collective sampling.

[# Project 5 "Covid Fear Elemental"](https://github.com/shauna2021/ShaunaSmith_Portfolio.Github.io/blob/main/SmithDSC530Project%20(1).ipynb)

The Covid Fear Elemental explores the G.A.S.(General Adaptation Syndrome) as a known effect on the human body. It infers the effects as measurements of fear on the human body and then predicts subsequent physiological & behavioral outcomes derived from that measurement. By comparing environments from within an increased state and a presumed absent state via the covid time windows. The differences can become a basis for demonstrating potential inferences based on the expected causes of extreme cases of death as related to a plausible fear influence.

[# Project 6 "Data Dream Jobs"](https://github.com/shauna2021/ShaunaSmith_Portfolio.Github.io/blob/main/Discovery_Assignments5.1_7.1_P2_SmithShauna.ipynb)

The Data Dream Jobs is a model developed to highlight student motivations for career choice advocacy within the data field & respective University programs. This is a predictive classification model that aims to predict the classification of Data Job types by using selective features derived from the motivational aspects that persuade student choice for entering and completing University programs.
