## F.E.R.B (Friendly Educational Repository Bank-of-pets)

The business problem 'FERB' seeks to resolve is the success rate for long term adoptions from both rescue institutions, kennel club associations, & local missions. This will assist in both breed endorsements and vested pet market industry, while also freeing resources previosly reserved for rehoming outcomes. Therefore, industries offering endorsement for classifying expectations & setting standards on decisions around candidates for desired family pets are imperative to their success story. Institutions such as the AKA(American Kennel Association) & publicly endorsed rescue centers can seek to gravitate towards a methodology platform that employs FERB and thereby ensuring all party's expectations and subsequent selection of pets are, "the right fit for the right family".

So, what does the right fit look like and how do we know when we find it?

"The pupose of life is the life of purpose" - Robin S. Sharma (NDA)

If the above quote offers us any indication into how to live life with purpose, we can quickly recognize the answer is often in the question.

Since no man is an island but all islands carry hidden treasures, what are the treasures any family or person seeking a pet is truly on the hunt for? Essentially, what questions will give us the answers we seek so we know what treasures we are truly looking for? With this line of thinking, the greatest answer for how to treasure hunt is often with a map. This is where FERB can help, this project can better identify and create an objective sense of locating better outcomes. Offering a type of proverbial map that helps us find the true treasures that sometimes we didn't even know we were looking for, but also helping us avoid the 'booby-traps' that sometimes lead us to unintended failure.

## Lessons Learned

### Conclusions & Recommendations
My conclusion is the accuracy of FERB is responding appropriately for the purposed purpose, but the limited training data as a correlation to classification is too small. Further supplementation of datapoints to reference from, in the form of mixed breeds and intermediate "level_4_success" ranges, could help yield better statistical reads of target classifications. However, as time and supplementatal datapoints are fed to the model strength in a more comprehensive analysis, and predictive nature to real world outcomes should become more apparent. Consequently, a decline in rehoming pets could be witnessed over time due to the advent of reinforced improvements detering "pet problems" from the onset. FERB could eventually become a valuable resource and preliminary policy implemented to support improvements with sucess stories for 'furever' homes. 

The concept of cataloging these data points could also serve as a valid resource for research and consumer marketing inference. Housing the non-identifing data or non PII(personally identifying information) could in turn draw not only intrigue and trust from prospective families, but also financial gains by way of donations and partnership on investments with the ASPCA. Using FERB as an essential standard in procedural methodologies in the adoption experience could demonstrate unseen and under-studied aspects relating to human behaviors and attachment. This could improve overall understanding surrounding how to help improve outcomes for both animal and human experiences. Therefore, I stronlgy recommend further investments and support around the maintenance and development of FERB and it's concept as a new necessary standrard positively worthy of implementation.
