                      "Why The Fear?"
When I was younger, we would visit my widowed Grandmother every other weekend and do chores to help around the acreage. When we arrived, I would hug her and ask the customary greeting of, “How are you?”. More often than not she would respond with, “I’m just waiting around to die”. Now, as morbid as this may sound, she always said it in a nonchalant manner. To her, death was just another part of life and was viewed as just another phase of her existence. “Humans are a part of nature, not apart from nature” (Author Unknown). Therefore, death was the last great phase of life, like going through puberty or menopause when one was fortunate enough to experience the gift of aging.  However, what she worried about most was never that she would someday die, but whether she would get to die on her own terms, without all the poking and prodding or the panic and fear in her environment. 

I learned so much from my grandmother, and how to handle fear or anxiety was just one of the many gifts she imparted to me while growing up. This gave me the innate confidence and courage to face many scenarios in my life. Sometimes this perspective gave me a distinct advantage to think with a more rational approach on a particular subject vs having ‘knee-jerk’ emotive responses. Regardless of the circumstance, I was always grateful for the lessons learned and the ability to potentially help others through their fears as well. At the root of it all, and as with every new venture, my ability to control my fear, rather than let fear control me, has always been an amazingly appreciated gift. In retrospect, managing fear in a healthy way has continuously been attributable to me becoming a victor, rather than a victim through life’s many continuous struggles. 

Fear seems equally present in both rendered scenarios, but the effects are always measured differently via the respondent’s reactions. Which brings me to my question, are we responsible for our deaths from fear, or is fear responsible for our deaths? How can we truly say that increasing fear in any situation is the same as potentially instigating deaths, can we truly be "scared to death"? 

First, I would state we have to prove that the increase in fear positively correlates with increased and established fear-related deaths. The last two years of the pandemic have created a unique environment, seemingly filled with a collective persistence of fear pushed onto a majority of the population. Although not everyone chose to share the same fears or experience them in the same ways or degrees, there was still an acknowledged and continuous state of propagated fear shared across the collective population. So, should we see a measurable effect of fear on the collective via increased fear-related deaths?

## Documentation

“Seek and ye shall find” are applicable to all discoveries and consequent innovations. However, if necessity is the mother of innovation, then it could be safe to say the father is an observation. A blind man will never see a new object, but a negligent man will never find it. If the cause is from the effect, then sometimes the effect will be absolved into the cause. If we know there was a collective experience involved in an environment under observation, then the data points could reflect that as a variable within itself via possible inference for the known effects of such an experience.

Since we know fear can invoke very real physical responses, the question becomes how much does prolonged fear in an environment produces those effects on the collective population. Specifically, what is the possible effect regarding the outcome of deaths in that population? Can we infer this physical effect from a known collective increase in deaths that stem from known fear responses? Will we see increased deaths directly related to known fear response categories when under this proposed increase of a fear-induced environment?

If our hearts determine our life, then it is safe to say, that which greatly affects the heart, greatly affects our life. So, what does the poison of fear do to the proverbial well source, of our hearts? If I taint the well, will all water drawn from this well, be tainted too? 

If one sees through the prisms of fear, is all they behold cloaked and received in fear? What is the effect of this on the heart, health, and behavior? An increased perspective sourced in a fear-based environment gains an advantage of a stronger cohort of the population from which to glean the potential effects associated with fear.

This article (listed above), lays out a well-documented perspective showing the known physical effects on the human body from a chronic state of fear and illustrates where we can see proven biological harms from prolonged exposures. Analyzing fear’s effect is a field of study long understood and well known, the aspect of G.A.S is commonly used in the field of recovery and analysis.
                                                
                        General Adaptation Syndrome (G.A.S):
Alarm-
“Primary stress hormones cortisol, adrenaline, and non-adrenaline are released.”
Resistance-
“There may be reduced defenses and adaptive energy left.”
Exhaustion-
“Referred to as overload, burnout, adrenal fatigue, maladaptation, or dysfunction.”

As known effects on the human body that are related to fear, we can potentially infer the effects as measurements of fear on the human body and subsequent behaviors. Within an increased fear environment and absent an increased fear environment the differences can become a basis for demonstrating potential inferences based on the expected causes of death related to fear.

Then, using variables of consideration of known available fear-related deaths(listed below), we can infer correlated effects caused by fear and their determined probability of cause.

•	Heart disease (Pre *2018-2019)
•	Heart Disease (in the midst *2020-2021)
•	Suicides (Pre *2018-2019)
•	Suicides (in the midst *2020-2021)
•	Overdose (Pre *2018-2019)
•	Overdose (in the midst *2020-2021)

## Lessons Learned

“Outcome of EDA”:

Null Hypothesis: - “Fear environments have no effect on deaths typically associated with known physiological fear responses and coping mechanisms.”

Alternative Hypothesis: - “Fear environments have an effect on deaths typically associated with known physiological fear responses and coping mechanisms.”

As a direct effort to define and accept or reject the null hypothesis, I had to derive from actual deaths of potential fear-related causes when assigned under proposed separate environments. This approach was one that establishes extremely speculative assumptions but allowed for the experimentation of proposed differences as a plausible explanation for increases. Elements of bias and alternative explanations for increases are notwithstanding due to undocumented precedence. Therefore, elemental behavior took priority over quantity as a defining interpretive measurement regarding the time spans.
 
Next, I had to establish my interpretations derived from the differences, rather than the direct correlations. Thus, by inverting the given outputs from the assigned code measurements for specific functions I could surmise the effect of fear. In turn, dependent on what and how an analysis was prepared, I would implement the inference of a present fear environment from the given results via the inversion or implementation of interpretations. 

In the end, I discovered that the rejection or acceptance of the null hypothesis varied dependent on the variable under analysis. I also recognized my approach was too broad and needed to be more refined. Additional constructs to the summations grounded in subjective states of assertion could be grounds for massive bias or sampling errors, but if assertions established are indicative of an objective approach, I would accept the null hypothesis for Overdoses, but reject the null hypothesis for Suicides and Diseases of the Heart. However, this is construed with reservations for bias regarding interpretation and application due to limited data collection and applied assumptions for environments of fear. 


“What do I feel was missed during the analysis?”:

In the case of some variables, there were notable differences. One difference under analysis was that of “Diseases of Heart” and the established correlation between spans allowed for an inference of fear potentially affecting the deaths from the analyzed environment. 

However, an unexpected outcome was for the variable of “Drug Overdoses”, which did not proportionately demonstrate robust results when interpreted for differences affected by fear. This led me to speculate that the unintentional aspect of a drug overdose remained consistent across the time spans. Ultimately, Overdoses were undeterred by changes in the proposed environmental condition of fear itself, when guided by corresponding date parameters alone.  This led me to think, that this could be accounted for by the overlap of fear in the “pre-years” cohort, or perhaps environmental factors are non-contributing outside of access to drug doses rather than accidental overconsumption of drug doses in response to an assumed fear state. However, that could be another interesting study on addictive behaviors and the causes of deaths from overdoses in and of itself. Either way, I was surprised by the outcome and the leading inferred summations for increased overdose deaths. 


“Were there any variables you felt could have helped in the analysis”:

If I had access to variables such as “emotional state of mind prior to death” rather than assigning a time span assumptively, I could better amass a correlation to fear. However, I was left to assign fear as an inferred assumption. Additional concepts for onset to develop a time series could have offered a filtration insight into actual emotive vs biological causes. I would have needed access to the declared respondent's medical history, BMI, Age, Stress, Living Conditions, Previous Diagnosis, etc. as other potential contributing characteristics that help refine factors of a fear environment from expected consequences of physical or deemed "normal" behavioral conditions.
